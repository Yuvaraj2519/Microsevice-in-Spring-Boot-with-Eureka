# Microservice in Spring boot with Eureka
+ The Spring Boot application is working as microservice by calling another using `service registry`/`Eureka`

## Method
+ We are using `rest template` here to achieve microservice architecture
+ Rather hard coding the end point url, we are getting instance using `load balancer client`
